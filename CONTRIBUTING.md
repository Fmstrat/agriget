Contributing
============
There are two ways to contribute to Agriget. One is to contribute directly to the upstream TT-RSS project, and the other is to contribute here, to Agriget directly.

When to contribute to TT-RSS
----------------------------
For back end functional updates and bug fixes, it is best to contribute to TT-RSS directly. This way, all users benefit from the code you are creating.

When to contribute to Agriget
-----------------------------
While TT-RSS is a strong and stable project built over the course of many years, it has been well documented that the author is not interested in accepting contributions that go outside of what is possible with the standard plug-in structure, regardless of if those features are optional for the users. This is the author's decision to ensure a long-term and stable product for his users and is of course an acceptable path for TT-RSS. Agriget was created to allow for an evolution of the UI and other areas of TT-RSS, and therefore exists as an open environment for users to contribute in these ways.
